**Efficient Python Code with Profiling Tools: %timeit and %lprun**

In Python development, understanding the performance of your code is crucial, especially when you're trying to optimize runtime. Two powerful tools that can help are `%timeit` and `%lprun`. Here's a quick guide on how to use them effectively to profile your code.

**1. %timeit - Measuring Execution Time**

The `%timeit` magic command in IPython and Jupyter notebooks is a handy tool for assessing the execution time of Python code. It runs the code multiple times to get a more accurate measurement of its average runtime, which helps in identifying slower sections of your code that could benefit from optimization.

To use `%timeit`, simply prefix the line of code or the cell with `%timeit` for a line or `%%timeit` for a whole cell. For example:
```python
%timeit sum([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
```
This will return the time taken to execute the sum function multiple times, giving you a clear picture of its efficiency.

**2. %lprun - Line-by-Line Profiling**

While `%timeit` is great for quick checks, `%lprun` from the `line_profiler` package allows for a more detailed line-by-line analysis. It shows the time spent on each line of a function, which is invaluable for deeper optimization efforts.

First, ensure you have `line_profiler` installed:
```bash
pip install line_profiler
```
Then, load the extension in your Jupyter notebook:
```python
%load_ext line_profiler
```
You can profile a function by specifying it with the `%lprun` command:
```python
%lprun -f my_function my_function(args)
```
This provides a detailed report where each line's execution count, time, and percentage of total time are clearly laid out, helping you pinpoint inefficiencies.
